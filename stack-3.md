## Stack Three
Stack Three looks at overwriting function pointers stored on the stack.

char *gets(char *);

void complete_level() {
  printf("Congratulations, you've finished " LEVELNAME " :-) Well done!\n");
  exit(0);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int (*fp)();
  } locals;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  locals.fp = NULL;
  gets(locals.buffer);

  if (locals.fp) {
    printf("calling function pointer @ %p\n", locals.fp);
    fflush(stdout);
    locals.fp();
  } else {
    printf("function pointer remains unmodified :~( better luck next time!\n");
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

## Challenge
The aim is to execute the function `complete_level` by modifying the `fp` variable.

## Solution
`locals.fp` is a function pointer and the function it points to gets called (`locals.fp()`).
We can overwrite it's value with the address of the function `complete_level()` in order to execute it.

### The Plan
Leverage `gets()` to overflow `locals.buffer` and write the address of `complete_level()` to `locals.fp`.

### Breaking it
> An `ELF` program's symbol table holds information needed to locate and relocate a program's symbolic definitions and references.
Symbols are a symbolic reference to some type of data or code such as a global variable or function.

Among the symbols we can find the address to `complete_level()`.

`0x000000000040069d` -> `complete_level()`
> Notice an address in `x64` architecture is 64 bits (8 bytes), also called a `QWORD`.

We know `locals.fp` is initialized to `NULL`, thus it is zerod out (`0x0000000000000000`) and because the system is `little-endian` we only need to write the least significant bytes (`0x40069d`).
